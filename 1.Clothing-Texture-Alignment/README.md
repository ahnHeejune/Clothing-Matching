# Clothing Texture Alignment (Boundary Extrapolation)
Clothing texture alignment or boundary extrapolation for matching the extended binary masks/silhouettes and hiding the artifacts generated in 3D clothing reconstruction.

## 1) Texture alignment using TPS transformation

## 2) Texture alignment using dilation operation
